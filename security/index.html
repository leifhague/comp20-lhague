	<h2>"Not Foursquare" Security Report</h2>
	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>I analyzed the “Not Foursquare” web application for security and privacy flaws.
	This app allows users to “check in” by sending data to the server, and stores a record
	of all of the check-ins in a database.  Users can view the list of previous check-ins by
	visiting www.vurnerableapp.herokuapp.com, and can search the database using query strings at
	www.vulnerableapp.herokuapp.com/checkins.json.</p>
	<h1>Methodology</h1>
	<p>I used the curl command line tool and the Mozilla Firefox web browser to send
	requests to the server.  In places where the website accepts input, I used a variety
	of input strings and known exploits to try to break the application.  I also looked
	at the source code in order to find less obvious vulnerabilities.</p>
	<h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
	<h3>1. XSS Vulnerability</h3>
	<p>The user-defined variable login is added to the database, and later displayed on
	the webpage, without any verification or modification of its contents, which presents
	a major problem.  This variable could contain anything, including a malicious script.
	Since the contents of login are put into an html file which is displayed anytime a client
	accesses the “Not Foursquare” homepage, any code that is added to the login field will
	execute on each client’s machine.  Fortunately, this problem can be solved with minor
	changes to server-vuln.js.  Before the user-set value of login is added to the database,
	html tags need to be removed from it.  This can be accomplished with a package such as
	sanitize-html https://www.npmjs.com/package/sanitize-html.</p>
	<h3>2. Cross Domain Requests are Enabled for all Domains</h3>
	<p>On the /sendLocation route, cross domain resource sharing is enabled for all
	domains.  This means that client side scripts originating at any domain could check in
	and receive back the list of all check-ins in the database.  Thus it would
	be possible for third parties to display the information provided at vulnerableapp.herokuapp.com
	in real time, potentially drawing away users.  CORS should not be available
	for all domains unless the purpose of the app is to provide a service to be used in
	client-side scripts.  If there are specific third parties that should be allowed to access this
	application, they can be whitelisted by replacing the asterisk with the name(s) of the
	domain()s in the line of code response.header(“Access-Control-Allow-Origin”, “*”);.</p>
	<h3>3. The Database has no Password/Security</h3>
	<p>It appears that the security of the database used by this
	project is lax.  Based on the JavaScript code used to access the MongoDB, the database
	doesn't seem to be password protected.  This means that the database can be accessed with
	knowledge of the machine’s IP address and the port number that is being used.
	The IP address is accessible by anyone who knows the URL of the website, while the
	default ports used by MongoDB can be found online.  While I was unable to
	access the database in this instance -- the server rejects the connect --
	the database's complete reliance on external security measures seems like a liability
	considering the security nightmare that could result from the database being accessed
	without authorization. In the event that attackers accessed that database, they could edit
	it at will and see all of the information contained in it.  Fortunately, it is not difficult
	to add password-protected accounts to a database.</p>
	<h1>Conclusion</h1>
	<p>While the "Not Foursquare" web app is currently lacking in security, the most serious
	problems are not difficult to fix.  Simply using a package to remove html from the
	user input would go a long way.  It would also be advisable to put a password on the
	database.  These changes would be inexpensive to make -- only the cost of labor would
	be required.</p>
