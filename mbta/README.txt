README for COMP 20 Lab 10
by Leif Hague

Note: I originally submitted a version of this lab before the deadline
(see commit "Lab 10 Done").  This new version fixes some of the problems that I was
working on up until the deadline.

Unfortunately, my implementation of this lab is not entirely complete:
-The JSON API for red line trains is not accessed

Code from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript
is incorporated into lab.js, marked by comments.

I worked on this lab for approximately 5 hours.
