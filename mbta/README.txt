README for COMP 20 Lab 10
by Leif Hague

Unfortunately, my implementation of this lab currently has a number of problems:
-While the distance to the nearest T station is calculated, it is not displayed
-The polyline connecting the user's location to the nearest T stop marker is not drawn
-The JSON API for red line trains is not accessed

Code from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript
is incorporated into lab.js, marked by comments.

I worked on this lab for approximately 3.5 hours.
